**Introduction**:     
This package implements a framework of Histograms of Sparse Coding, which validates a Pedestrian Classifier (by their different postures and directions).     
And a K-SVD Dictionary Learning algorithm is contributed for the training phase.     

**Platform:**     
This program is tested on Matlab r2010b, 64bit, Ubuntu.     
It is highly recommended that no matter what your platform is, **you should re-compile all the mex-files**    

**Usage:**      
1. Download LIB-SVM from http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ and re-compile it.     
2. Run compile.m    
3. Run demo.m, but bear in mind that K-SVD and SVM-training are both time-consuming.     
4. More specific intepretations in demo.m.
